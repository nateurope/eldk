	  Additional receive skb headroom. Note, that driver
	  will always reserve at least 2 bytes to make IP header
	  aligned, so usually there is no need to add any additional

	  On some platforms, the first EMAC's are not used. This is
	  often the case on 440GX platform, where EMAC0 & EMAC1 are
	  not GBit capable. This option allows to skip some of the
	  first EMAC's in the enumberation, so that for example
	  "eth0" equals EMAC2 of the PPC.
