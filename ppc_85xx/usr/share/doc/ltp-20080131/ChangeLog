15) Log Message:
Huge Changes from Cai Qian <qcai@redhat.com>. Please see the Description
below:

The updated version
has the following improvments,

- simplify maintenance

- fix several bugs

- better automation

- extend support on Debian and Fedora

- merge Poornima Nayak <Poornima.Nayak@in.ibm.com> 's latest patch

- other changes

The new version simplifies code layout, and all tools under lib/
directory are standalone and reusable, all configurable variables are
under the file runkdump.conf. There are also included sample
configuration files for different distros and test components. In
addition, it avoided code duplication by merging RHEL and SLES specified
code in lkdtm module together, and add a checking before hand. The
working flow in main script has also been tidied up. verify and
verify_dump have been unified. unused file "summary" has been deleted.

In previous version,
* The part of comparing kernel version in setup will not work proper
  if the kernel grows to something like 2.7.1 or 2.8.1.
* verify_dump will not able to find previous vmcore if vmcore creation
  and vmcore verfication happen at different hours.
* Other random bugs because of code complexity.

In the new version, once you define everything in a config file, it will
run in an automatically fashion on some of systems, if there is proper
tools installed.

The code has been rewritten in POSIX shell syntax, and made more
portable, and attempted to remove hard-coded stuff as much as
possible. It has been tested fairly on RHEL5.1, SLES10sp1, Debian
unstable, and Fedora 8. If needed I can send you result logs. Sachin
has done a quick test on PPC64 machine running RHEL5.1 and the script
run fine. Poornima has done some code review.
Poornima's patch has been merged,
1. Crashkerenl reservation check is modified to support any craskernel
value.  
2. A message before system reboots
3. Added one more line to 'status' if dump verification passed.
4. Modified 'README' file
5. If kdump start fails for invalid arguments in kdump.conf is fixed
6. Replaced MAKE_OPTS with MAKE_OPTIONS.
7. Removed some unwanted statements.

Other changes included that all tests descriptions have been documented
in doc/ALL_TEST.txt. KNLD (dump over scp with link delay) test case has
been merged into KNSCP (dump over scp). Once LINK_DELAY has been defined
somewhere in configuration file, all test cases (KNSCP and KNNFS)
dumping to a network destination will take advantage of it. If
LINK_DELAY is not defined or equals to 0, KNSCP and KNNFS will just the
same as in previous version.

New option:
 -D Run LTP under additional background Load on Secondary Storage

Options that have a different interface:
 -i Run LTP under additional background Load on IO Bus
 -m Run LTP under additional background Load on Main memory

Remember that this change will break the script interface.

-The random syscall generator has a bug on x86-64 where it only generates 
 random bits for the upper 32 bits of the syscall argument, and then truncates
 the upper 32 bits anyway!  This patch replaces the rand() weirdness with a 
 function that generates N bytes of random data instead. It also adds a -z 
 flag in case one *wants* the zero-arguments behavior; Max Asbock and Russ 
 Weight requested it because zero is a quick way to find kernel code paths
 that don't check userland pointers.

22-1.c, 22-2.c

-A patch by David Stevens that fixes: 1) Removes signedness warning by changing the type of valsize from int to socklen_t 2) Correct but in ancillary data - sorce data is unit8_t, memcopy size is "sizeof(int)"; this results in garbage and TBROK on PPC64

-A fix for bug #27618 that addresses two issues: 1) PAGE_SIZE which was normally 4096, but on the machine it found to 64k ! 2) The size of the file, offset passed. If those values, happen to be on the *Page boundary*, mmap would be happy. But in our case, it was not ! 
fsx-linux.c

-Changing include <posixtest.h> to include "posixtest.h" 
1-1.c

-A patch by Darrick Wong that adds a set of rudimentary IPMI tests to pounder.  They check that the in-kernel IPMI driver can access the machine's BMC/SP (if there is one), query it for status and check for various IPMI 2.0 features.

ns-icmpv6_sender.c, ns-igmp_querier.c
	
-Made changes to avoid hardcoding test count 
mkdir03.c, open08.c

-Changed the test to account for SLES 10.  Now the syslog tests will test 
 syslog-ng or syslogd depending on which one is present.  The update was     
 made for syslog01 - syslog10. 

-Corrected the copyright information to reflect SGI, instead of Cray, which
 was purchased by SGI years ago for files get_high_address.c, search_path.c

-Removed the Ping test. The ping test is now skipped on SLES, but does not 
  affect the execution of the rest of the test in mc_commo	

-Using syscall() rather than _syscall#() macros for the following files:
  sysfs01.c, sysfs02.c, sysfs03.c, sysfs04.c, sysfs05.c, sysfs06.c,  
  sysctl01.c, sysctl03.c, sysctl04.c, sysctl05.c

getdents04.c	

-Added a fix to re-order testcases a little to account for uclinux in 
access05.c, lstat02.c, mknod06.c

-A Correction was made to the name of the testcase in code...was incorrectly 
called signal_test_03  and changed to signal_test_02.c

-A fix to  get the max pid value at runtime rather than compile time hardcode 
wait402.c, setpriority04.c,Makefile, getsid02.c

-A fix to remove extraneous include 
swapon02.c

- mc_cmds had two fixes.  The test now uses [ae]th[01] in the ping command 
using the -I option. Also the loop to determine which ethernet interface 
is needed was moved to ensure that the correct ethernet interface was selected.

-A patch was addded that allows the following files to get the PID_MAX value 
from /proc/sys/kernel/pid-max: 
access05.c, fcntl15.c, gethostid01.c, lstat02.c, mknod06.c, setrlimit02.c, 
setsockopt01.c, stat03.c, truncate03.c	

LTP-20060717
 - The tarball default-tests.tar.gz is a replacement for
   testcases/pounder21/default-tests.tar.gz.  This new pounder config
   enables the magic sysrq key when pounder starts.   
 - A patch submitted by Derek Wong to reduce the memory requirements of
   pounder's ramsnake test.
 - A patch submitted by Will Newton that allows for compatibility changes
   gcc 2.95.2 in th following files:
     lib.c, lib64.c, test.c, test64.c, test_func.c, test_func64.c, tools.c
 - Fixed ColdFire Makefile mistake in the syscall and syscalls/mmap directory
 - Added a note for uClinux users in the top level Makefile
 - A fix for failures in fcntl27 and fcntl28 for bugs 21614 and 23235.
 - A fix submitted for make_tree.c by Jacky Malcles that fixes this
   testcase by setting envp
  - A fix submitted to Jacky Malcles that fixes read_checkzero.c.  The lseek
   function allows the file offset to be set beyond the end of the existing
   end-of-file of the file.  If data is later written at this point,
   subsequent reads of the data is in the gap returns bytes of zeros until
   data is actually written into the gap.
 - In the testcase semget05.c the value of MAXIDS was changed for the specific
   machine by reading the system limit for SEMMNI - The maximum number of
   semaphore sets. This is a fix for bug 24745
 - A fix submitted by Amit K. Amora that initializes the alarm received
   code and allows the test to pass more than just once on 2.6.17-rc6
   alarm05.c,
 - A fix was submitted by Andy Echols for pan.c to fix an infinite
   loop problem that occurs  in pan if runltp tries to run a test
   that isn't present.
 - A fix was submitted to cast TEST_RETURN to gid_t to avoid implicit casts
   which tend to cause problems with the testcase  setregid03.c,
 - A patch submitted by Jacky Malcles that fixes the problem where
   i0_getevents() return value is not checked and may return 0 if
   no events are available and may generate a SIGSEGV in the testcase
   aiodio_append.c,
 - Backed out the _USC_LIB change for several Makefiles because it was
   breaking on the PowerPc platform on Fedora Core
 - Added code to ignore looking for PID_MAX on powerpc, s390, and i386 to
   fix build problems on newer kernel versions on the following files:
    sysctl05.c, setpriority04.c sysfs01.c, sysfs02.c, sysfs03.c, sysfs04.c,
    sysfs06. getdents01.c, sysctl03.c getsid02.c, sysctl01.c,wait402.c
 - TCP.c was changed to delete broken whitespace and also the call for
   accept(2) takes a socklen_t, not an int
 - Changes were added to the following files to use memset() instead of
   bzero():
   tlibio.c, write_log.c, doio.c, iogen.c, fsstress.c, fsx-linux.c,
   pthcli.c, pthserv.c, pth_str01.c, pth_str03.c, recvmsg01.c, sendmsg01.c,

LTP-20060615
-Added a patch from Darrick Wong to reduce the memory requirements of 
 pounder's ramsnaketes
-Added a patch for crash01.c from Olof Johansson <olof@lixom.net>
 POWER5 has coherent icache, but POWER4, PPC970 and some other processors
 lack it. The standard dcbst/icbi/isync is needed to avoid using the not
 so random (or stale) data instead.
-Test.h was moved to common headers to eliminate the need for every test file to
 declare Tst_count extern
-Usctest.h was changed to eliminate scope issues when actually using TEST()
-Added a patch from Mike Gahangan to clean up a makefile with an extra build 
 target variable.  
-Added a patch from Issac Wilcox that can keeps the test from returning a false
 failure
-Made changes to setregid02, setregid03 and setregid04 to use gid_t instead 
 of int where appropriate
-Made changes to setresgid01, setresgid02,setresgid03, setresuid01,setresuid02,
 and setresuid03  to pull the [gs]etre* prototypes from headers rather than 
 defining them ourself
-Made changes to setreuid01,setreuid02,setreuid03,setreuid04,and setreuid05
 to use uid_t instead of int where appropriate
- Added a change to getpriority01 to combine the TEST_RETURN and TEST_ERRNO 
  if check so that we always display PASS or FAIL messages as pointed out 
  by Isaac Wilcox
- Added a patch to make the output of fork07 deterministic.
  Specifically, make sure stdout is flushed before forking 100 times,
  else you can get 101 copies of the output.  This only seems to happen
  if glibc notices that stdout is a regular file, but in my test setup
  stdout is always redirected to a file and compared with something.
-Changed the declaration for setup and cleanup from extern in the 
 following files:

 alarm01,chdir02,chown01,close08,creat09,dup0,dup04,execl01,execle01,execlp01,
 execv01,execve01,execvp01,fchmod01,fchown01,fcntl02,fcntl03,fcntl04,fcntl05,

- Fixed ftp01 and telnet01 seems designed to run with non-root user connection
  when the user name is set to RUSER environment variable.
  However, it is incomplete.ftp01 creates a directory whose permission is root.

  can build and execute the test without it now.
- Change for defect 13778, when the /var/log/messages file is first moved, the first write fails
- The SIGINT sighandler will set the "intinitr" flag to 1 for the children. But if the
  "runtime" is small( a command line argument passed, the testcases were running
  for 5 secs here), it may happen that the SIGINT may be recieved before the
  child initialize the flag to 0, and which may lead to a hang
- Change to exclude lib6 directory from default build since it breaks earlier Distros
- Added code to handle cases where certain distros don't define AI_V4MAPPED in /usr/include/netdb.h
