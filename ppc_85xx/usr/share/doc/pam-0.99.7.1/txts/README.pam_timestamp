This is pam_timestamp, a module for implementing sudo-style authentication
timestamps via PAM.

Background:  sudo [1] provides a means for allowing certain users (by name,
or by group membership) to execute a fixed set of commands under a different
UID (even root).  Additionally, sudo adds the concept of timestamp files,
which will allow a user to use commands via sudo, without needing to reenter
her password, within a short period after a previous command was run.

The authentication service function checks for the existence and validity of
the timestamp file, and if a valid timestamp file exists which is less than
timestamp_timeout seconds old, succeeds.

The session management service creates or updates the timestamp file.  This
means that in order for a service to use this module, it must perform PAM
session management.

The module takes these arguments:
	debug			Log debug messages (with priority DEBUG) to
				syslog.
	timestampdir		The directory in which timestamp files will be
				stored and checked for.  The default setting is
				"/var/run/sudo".
	timestamp_timeout	The number of seconds which can pass after its
				creation during which a timestamp is file is
				considered to be valid.  The default setting,
				which mirrors sudo's, is 600 (five minutes).
	verbose			Attempt to tell the user when access is granted.
