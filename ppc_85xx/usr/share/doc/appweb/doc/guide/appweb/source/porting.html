Porting AppWeb</b>
			</h1></div>
			<div class="guideSection">
              
      
<p>Porting any software is not for the novice, it requires considerable 
                skill to read someone else's code and to adapt it to a new environment. 
                These instructions are intended for experienced and talented developers 
                who want to port the Mbedthis AppWeb product to a new O/S or processor 
                architecture. </p>

              
      <p>Mbedthis AppWeb has been written to maximize the ease of porting 
                to a new environment. The O/S and processor dependent code has 
                been contained to a few files while the bulk of the code is cross-platform. 
                Most of this code is under the <b>mpr</b> sub-directory which 
                represents the Mbedthis Portable Run-time Executive.<br>
</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: </span>When
attempting
a port, you should get the latest copy of the development source branch
rather than using the download source package. You can get the latest
development source by checking out a copy from the Subversion
repository. Send email to <a href="mailto:dev@mbedthis.com">dev@mbedthis.com </a>to request to be added to the Subversion authorization database. You will then be given checkout instructions. <br>
 </p>


              
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: </span>Please read <a href="building.html">Building from Source</a> before your read this document. It provide valuable background about the AppWeb build system.<br>
</p>

              
      <h2><a name="newOs"></a>

			<a href="#top"><img width="16" height="16" class="nav" src="../../../images/upArrow.gif"></a>

Porting to a new Operating System</h2>

              
      <p>Follow the following steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Select the Required AppWeb Features</strong><br />
          <br />
          Copy conf/appweb/normal.conf to conf/appweb/myport.conf and edit and modify the feature selection as required.  In your myport.conf defaults file, pay attention to the BLD_HOST_OS, BLD_HOST_CPU and your required FEATURE
selections. You may need to define new MPR_CPU constants in the mpr/mprOs.h file if you are doing a port to a new CPU architecture that is not already supported. <br />
<br />
You should turn BLD_FEATURE_MULTITHREAD off (use configure --disable-multi-thread) for your first porting effort as it will make debugging much easier. Disable all the features that your O/S does not support. See the <a href="building.html">Building from Source</a> document for definitions of all the build variables used in these files. If your system is UNIX like, make sure you set BLD_UNIX_FOR_HOST to 1 in the conf/appweb configuration files described below. Also remember to modify the BLD_DEFAULTS setting to the name of your defaults file.<br />
<br />
        </li>
<li><strong>Run configure for the new target operating system. <br />
              <br />
            </strong>Run the configure program and specify the --host and --build switches. These switches take arguments of the form: CPU-VENDOR-OS. The conf/config.sub script validates these arguments. Most probably, your O/S and CPU architecture are already in this file. Review the file to see what is the best way to refer to your required O/S and CPU architecture. If you can't find your choices, you may need to modify this script to add a new operating system or CPU.<br />
            <br />
            When ready, run configure to generate the config.make, config.sh and config.h master build files. For example: <br />
            <br />
            ./configure --product appweb --defaults myport --host powerpc-wrs-vxworks --build i586-pc-cygwin --disable-multi-thread<br />
            <br />
            <br />
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Pick a Name for the Operating System Port</span><br>
              <br>
              If you are doing a port for a new operating system you need to pick a symbolic name that will be used in Makefiles, build scripts and for per
operating system directories. Use all CAPS for your OS name without any "_" or "-" characters. For example: "LINUX" is the AppWeb name for the
Linux specific portions. For the rest of this document, we will use the
name <b>NEWOS</b> for the 
                    O/S symbolic name.<br />
                    <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Select the Base O/S to Copy</span><br>
                  <br>
The easiest way to port to a new O/S is to find the closest existing
supported O/S that the AppWeb software already supports and use it as a
base to modify. For example if you are porting to QNX, you may want to
use the LINUX port as a base. You will need to copy some base O/S
directories and configuration files to become the starting point for
your new port. The directories to copy are (assuming we are copying the
LINUX port)<br>
          <br>
          <pre>cp -R mpr/UNIX mpr/NEWOS</pre>

          
          <p>At this stage, don't copy all the per O/S package
directories and files. These are used to create installable packages
(E.g. RPM packages). If your system is UNIX-like, then you will use the
mpr/UNIX/*.cpp files.<br>
<br />
        </p>
        </li>
<li>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tailor the make.os.NEWOS file<br>
            <br>
            </span>This step is probably one of the longest. You need to
  edit the conf/make.os.NEWOS file and change all the compiler and linker
  flag values for your operating system. See the <a href="building.html">Building from Source</a> document for definitions of all the make variables used in this file. When finished, copy this to <em>make.os</em> in the top level directory. It will be included by all Makefiles. <br>
            <br>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tailor the cross-platform O/S header.</span><br>
                  <br>
                  To insulate most of the AppWeb source code from the differences 
                  of various operating systems, the <b>mprOs.h</b> header file 
                  wraps all the required O/S headers and publishes a consistent 
                  set of types and prototypes. None of the source files include 
                  normal O/S headers like &lt;string.h&gt;. While this does slow 
                  builds down by including more headers than are required -- on 
                  modern CPUs it is barely noticeable.<br>
                  <br>
                  When porting mprOs.h, start by copying the sections in mprOs.h 
                  that pertain to your base copied O/S. These will be protected 
                  by "#if BASE_OS" defines. In the example of NEWOS, 
                  we would look for and copy any sections with "#if LINUX" 
                  and create "#if NEWOS" sections.<br>
              <br>
              Also look for the string "PORTERS" for tips of what to modify.<br>
                  <br>
                  DO NOT introduce conditional code in other O/S sections. It 
                  is better to copy the entire contents from the base O/S and 
                  modify. Replication here benefits greatly later on by isolating 
                  subtle changes from one O/S to another. <br>
                  <br>
            </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tailor the Primary MPR header</span> 
                  <p>Next we edit the <span style="font-weight: bold;">mpr.h</span> header. Some operating system differences escape from mprOs.h and 
                      must be dealt with here. Search for sections that pertain 
                      to the base O/S and modify. It is acceptable and indeed preferable 
                      to modify sections rather than replicate. For example</p>
                    <p> #if LINUX || QNX</p>
                    <p> is better and clearer than duplicate code.<br />
                    	<br />
                    </p>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Test the Headers with a Hello World Program.</span> 
              <p> Don't use the make system yet. Just create an empty C++ hello 
                      world program and include "mpr.h". Compile it and 
                      shake out the issues. You will need to define "-DNEWOS" on your compiler command line.<br />
                      <br />
              </p>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Port the Per O/S MPR Source Code</span><br>
              <br>
					Now is the time for the real work. Most of the operating 
					system dependent code is confined to three source files: 
					thread.cpp, mprOs.cpp and daemon.cpp. Thread.cpp contains 
					the multiprocessing thread, lock and condition variable 
					code. If you only intend to support single-threading, 
					you can largely skip these code sections. Copy these three 
					files from your base O/S into the <b>mpr/NEWOS</b> directory 
						and modify as required.<br>
              <br>
            </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Test the Make Subsystem</span><br>
              <br>
					To aid the porting to many operating systems, a simple 
					build system is provided that is somewhat compatible with GNU configuration standards. While the GNU Autoconf/Libtool 
					system could arguably do the job, it struggles in non-Unix 
					environments. The AppWeb build and make system makes fewer demands on 
					the underlying operating system and is simpler in scope. 
					<p>The make subsystem requires GNU make and a fairly compliant 
                    bash shell implementation. If you are using windows, the CYGWIN 
                    package will provide the GNU environment. If you are porting 
                    to an O/S that uses the GNU development tools, you probably 
                    have little to do in this step. If not, you may have more 
                    modifications required to your make.rules file.<br />
                    <br />
					</p>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Test Compile the Mpr</span> 
				    <p> To start out, test compile one file in MPR first. Let's 
                      pick an easy one: <b>buf.cpp. </b>The
  AppWeb build system compiles objects for most directories into a common
  objects directory (./obj on Linux and on Windows: ./obj/Debug or
  ./obj/Release). This is done to make it easier to aggregate objects
  from various modules into common libraries. So to compile a single
  object, you need to specify the target object which will usually not be
  in the current directory.<br>
            <b>
                    <br>
				      </b>cd mpr<br>
                      make ../obj/buf.o </p>
						  <p>At this stage of the porting effort, this will undoubtedly provoke a stream of errors. Use this 
							  to work out the bugs in mprOs.h, mpr.h and make.rules 
							  for your O/S.<br />
							  <br />
						  </p>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Compile the Rest of the MPR<br>
              <br>
            </span>Once you have buf.cpp compiling, try the rest of the MPR.<br>
              <br>
              make <br>
              <br>
            </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Test your Port of thread.cpp and mprOs.cpp</span> 
              <p> The mpr, ejs, http and appweb directories all have extensive 
                      unit test suites to help you shake out the bugs.<br>
                Run:</p>
                    <p>cd mpr/test<br>
                      make test<br />
                      <br />
                    </p>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Compile and Test ejs -- the Embedded JavaScript Interpreter</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
              <br>
              This code should compile and build easily. It is quite cross-platform 
               		<p> cd ejs<br>
                    make clean depend compile test<br />
               		</p>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;"> Compile the HTTP Web Server and Modules</span><br>
              <br>
              We should be accelerating by now. Again, this module is mostly 
              cross-platform. Try: 
               		<p> cd http<br>
                    make clean depend compile<br />
                    <br />
               		</p>
        </li>
        <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test HTTP</span> 
           		    <p> cd test<br>
                      make test<br />
                      <br />
           		    </p>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Port AppWeb</span><br>
              <br>
					The appweb directory only contains the main programs. 
					All other functionality it provided by mpr, ejs and http. 
					You may have some modifications in the main programs to 
					setup your run-time environment correctly. Issues like 
					multithreading or single-threading are controlled here. 
			</li>
      </ol>
