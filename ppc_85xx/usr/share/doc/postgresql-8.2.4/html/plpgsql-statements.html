><P
>     An assignment of a value to a <SPAN

><TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>identifier</I
></TT
> := <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>expression</I
></TT
>;</PRE
><P>
     As explained above, the expression in such a statement is evaluated
     by means of an SQL <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SELECT</TT
> command sent to the main
     database engine.  The expression must yield a single value.
    </P
><P
>     If the expression's result data type doesn't match the variable's
     data type, or the variable has a specific size/precision
     (like <TT
CLASS="TYPE"
>char(20)</TT
>), the result value will be implicitly
     converted by the <SPAN
CLASS="APPLICATION"
>PL/pgSQL</SPAN
> interpreter using
     the result type's output-function and 
     the variable type's input-function. Note that this could potentially
     result in run-time errors generated by the input function, if the
     string form of the result value is not acceptable to the input function.

     <TT

     It would be a very bad idea to try to do the above example as
</P><PRE
CLASS="PROGRAMLISTING"
>EXECUTE 'UPDATE tbl SET '
        || quote_ident(colname)
        || ' = $$'
        || newvalue
        || '$$ WHERE key = '
        || quote_literal(keyvalue);</PRE
><P>
     because it would break if the contents of <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>newvalue</TT
>
     happened to contain <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>$$</TT
>.  The same objection would
     apply to any other dollar-quoting delimiter you might pick.
     So, to safely quote text that is not known in advance, you
     <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>must</I
></SPAN
> use <CODE
CLASS="FUNCTION"
>quote_literal</CODE
>.
    </P

><P
>     There are several ways to determine the effect of a command. The
     first method is to use the <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>GET DIAGNOSTICS</TT
>
     command, which has the form:

</P><PRE
CLASS="SYNOPSIS"
>GET DIAGNOSTICS <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>variable</I
></TT
> = <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>item</I
></TT
> [<SPAN
CLASS="OPTIONAL"
> , ... </SPAN
>];</PRE
><P>

     This command allows retrieval of system status indicators.  Each
     <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>item</I
></TT
> is a key word identifying a state
     value to be assigned to the specified variable (which should be
     of the right data type to receive it).  The currently available
     status items are <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>ROW_COUNT</TT
>, the number of rows
     processed by the last <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> command sent down to
     the <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> engine, and <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>RESULT_OID</TT
>,
     the OID of the last row inserted by the most recent
     <ACRONYM
CLASS="ACRONYM"
>SQL</ACRONYM
> command.  Note that <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>RESULT_OID</TT
>
     is only useful after an <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>INSERT</TT
> command into a
     table containing OIDs.
