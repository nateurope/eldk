In iso04.f08 and iso10.f08 the letters K, and k,
(letter k with cedilla) are wrong.
In iso07.f08 and iso10.f08 the horizontal bar is wrong.
In lat0u-14.psf positions 167, 168 (decimal) are wrong.

Maybe someone with font editor can correct this.
(Compare with *.f14 and *.f16 to see the right version.)
